## Notes

Some challenges I had was adjusting to using useEffect() for fetching data from the database as it is a relatively new concept that I am learning and something I would like to expand on through the Web103 course. Also using async functions and working with promises to wait until a function or operation finishes processing was something I also spent some time understanding.
